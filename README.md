Here I created a Stock Analysis and Prediction project of Apple and Microsoft using Machine learn . 

The following concepts were used :

1.Python programming language

2.NumPy library for scientific computing

3.Data Wrangling for cleaning the data

4.Matplotlib library for data visualization

5.Data normalization for data preparation

6.Data Modeling for creating visual representations

5.Data manipulation, such as creating arrays, accessing and modifying elements, and slicing arrays

6.Data visualization using line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.

The overall aim of the code is to fetch the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft from Yahoo Finance API, visualize the data, normalize it, apply linear regression, and visualize the regression results.






Happy Learning :)
